Below is a full requirements document for a UI that leverages the Llama Stack API endpoints. This document outlines the project’s purpose, functional and non-functional requirements, and high-level design considerations. Let me know if you’d like any additional details or modifications.

UI Requirements Document for Llama Stack Integration
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for a user interface (UI) application that fully leverages the Llama Stack API endpoints. The UI will serve as a front-end for interacting with various Llama Stack components (inference, agents, tool calling, evaluations, etc.), streamlining the workflow for developers and end users building generative AI applications.

1.2 Scope
Integration: The UI must integrate seamlessly with all core Llama Stack API endpoints.
User Interaction: It will provide an intuitive interface for creating, configuring, and monitoring API calls, including chat completions, streaming responses, and tool calling.
Platform: The UI is designed as a web application that can run in modern browsers and be responsive for desktop and mobile views.
Extensibility: The design should allow for future enhancements and additional API functionality.
1.3 Stakeholders
Developers: Require a clear, intuitive interface to interact with the Llama Stack for development, testing, and production deployment.
Project Managers & Product Owners: Need insights, monitoring, and usage statistics.
End Users: May interact with specific features (e.g., tool calling demonstrations or evaluations) in a simplified mode.
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The UI is a standalone front-end application that communicates with a Llama Stack server. It will act as both a demonstration tool and a development aid, abstracting complexities of the API endpoints into a user-friendly interface.

2.2 Product Functions
API Interaction Panel: Allow users to select an endpoint (chat completions, streaming responses, tool calling, etc.), set parameters, and execute API calls.
Real-Time Response Display: Display responses in real-time (with streaming support where applicable).
Tool Management: Allow definition, configuration, and testing of tool calling functionalities.
Session & History Tracking: Maintain a log/history of API calls, responses, and errors for review.
Configuration & Settings: Enable users to configure API base URLs, timeout/retry settings, and authentication tokens if needed.
2.3 User Characteristics
Technical Users/Developers: Familiar with API concepts, JSON, and basic programming.
Non-technical Stakeholders: Require simple, guided interactions for demonstration and testing purposes.
Mobile/Desktop Users: The interface must be responsive and accessible.
2.4 Operating Environment
Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
Internet connectivity required for API calls.
Backend: Llama Stack server (local, on-premises, or cloud deployed).
3. Specific Requirements
3.1 Functional Requirements
3.1.1 API Endpoint Selection
FR-1: Provide a drop-down or tabbed menu for selecting available Llama Stack API endpoints.
FR-2: Display a brief description and usage guidelines for each endpoint.
3.1.2 Request Parameter Configuration
FR-3: Allow users to configure request parameters using dynamic forms (e.g., input fields for messages, model selection, sampling parameters).
FR-4: Validate inputs based on the API schema (e.g., required fields, data types).
3.1.3 API Call Execution & Response Handling
FR-5: Execute API calls upon user request and display the full response in a readable format (JSON viewer or formatted text).
FR-6: Support both synchronous and asynchronous (streaming) responses.
FR-7: Handle error responses gracefully with clear error messages and suggestions.
3.1.4 Tool Calling Interface
FR-8: Allow users to define and manage custom tool definitions (name, description, parameters).
FR-9: Enable tool testing through a dedicated UI section that leverages the tool calling endpoint.
3.1.5 Session & History Management
FR-10: Log all API interactions with details (timestamp, endpoint, parameters, response, error codes).
FR-11: Allow users to review and re-run previous API calls.
3.1.6 Configuration and Settings
FR-12: Provide a settings panel to configure API base URL, timeout settings, and retry options.
FR-13: Allow for user authentication setup if required by the API (API keys, tokens).
3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
3.2.1 Usability
NFR-1: The UI should follow user-centric design principles (simplicity, consistency, and clarity) and be accessible (meeting WCAG guidelines).
NFR-2: The interface must be intuitive enough for both developers and non-technical users.
NFR-3: Provide clear documentation and in-app help/tooltips for each feature.
3.2.2 Performance
NFR-4: The UI should respond to user interactions within 2 seconds.
NFR-5: API response display (especially streaming responses) should update in real-time with minimal delay.
3.2.3 Reliability & Error Handling
NFR-6: The UI must gracefully handle network issues and display fallback error messages.
NFR-7: Retry logic (configurable) should be implemented in the API layer, with error details presented to the user.
3.2.4 Security
NFR-8: Secure storage and transmission of any authentication tokens or sensitive data.
NFR-9: Ensure input validation to prevent injection attacks and other common vulnerabilities.
3.2.5 Maintainability
NFR-10: Code should be modular, well-documented, and follow modern development best practices.
NFR-11: The UI must support easy updates when Llama Stack APIs are extended or modified.
3.2.6 Scalability
NFR-12: The UI should be designed to accommodate additional endpoints and new features with minimal refactoring.
3.3 External Interfaces
3.3.1 API Interface
The UI communicates with the Llama Stack server using RESTful HTTP endpoints as defined in the Llama Stack API documentation.
Use standardized JSON payloads for both request and response formats.
3.3.2 User Interface
Web-based, responsive design that adapts to desktop and mobile browsers.
Incorporate common UI patterns (navigation menus, forms, modals) to ensure ease of use.
4. Use Cases
4.1 Chat Completion Use Case
User Action: User selects the “Chat Completion” endpoint.
Input: User enters a message and selects a model.
System: UI validates the input, sends a request to the API.
Output: Response is displayed in a chat window; if streaming is enabled, the text appears progressively.
4.2 Tool Calling Use Case
User Action: User navigates to the “Tool Calling” section.
Input: User defines a new tool (name, description, parameters) and submits it.
System: UI sends tool definition to the API and confirms registration.
Output: User can test the tool by sending a request; results are displayed in real time.
4.3 Session History and Re-run
User Action: User reviews previous API calls from a history panel.
Input: User selects a historical request.
System: UI displays the request and response details.
Output: User can modify parameters and re-run the API call.
5. UI/UX Considerations
5.1 Visual Design
Consistency: Follow a consistent visual style (colors, typography, spacing) aligned with modern UI best practices.
Clarity: Use clear labels, tooltips, and error messages to guide the user.
Responsiveness: Ensure the layout adjusts well for various screen sizes.
5.2 Interaction Design
Feedback: Provide immediate visual feedback on user actions (e.g., loading spinners, success/error notifications).
Error Prevention: Use form validations and disable inappropriate actions to prevent errors.
Simplicity: Design the interface with a minimalistic approach, exposing only necessary details while hiding advanced options under expandable menus.
5.3 Accessibility
Adhere to WCAG 2.1 standards to ensure that the UI is accessible to users with disabilities.
Use semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, and ensure keyboard navigability.
6. Future Enhancements
Multi-Language Support: Allow the UI to be easily translated to support non-English users.
Advanced Analytics: Integrate dashboards for monitoring API usage statistics and performance metrics.
Customizable Workflows: Provide drag-and-drop interface elements for building custom API workflows.
