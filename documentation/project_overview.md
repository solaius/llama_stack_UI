# Llama Stack UI - Project Overview

## Introduction

Llama Stack UI is a modern, responsive web interface designed to interact with the Llama API. It provides a user-friendly way to manage and interact with AI agents, tools, and tool groups. The application is built with React and Material-UI, offering a clean and intuitive user experience.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client**: A React application built with TypeScript and Material-UI
- **Server**: A Node.js Express server that acts as a proxy to the Llama API

### Client Structure

The client is organized as follows:

- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `Agents/`: Components related to agent management
  - `Tools/`: Components related to tool management
  - `Chat/`: Components for the chat interface
  - `Common/`: Shared components used throughout the application
- `src/pages/`: Page components that represent different routes
- `src/services/`: Service modules for API communication
- `src/contexts/`: React context providers
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions

### Server Structure

The server is a simple Express application that:

- Proxies requests to the Llama API
- Handles authentication (if configured)
- Provides additional endpoints for UI-specific functionality

## Key Features

### Agent Management

- Create, edit, and delete AI agents
- Configure agent parameters (model, instructions, sampling parameters)
- Assign tool groups to agents
- View agent details and history

### Tool Management

- View available tools from the Llama API
- Create and manage tool groups
- Test tools directly from the UI

### Chat Interface

- Interact with agents through a chat interface
- View tool usage and agent responses
- Manage chat sessions

### User Interface

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Dark and light theme support
- Intuitive navigation and controls
- Consistent styling across all components

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript
- **Material-UI**: React component library implementing Google's Material Design
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **Axios**: Used for API requests to the Llama API

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: Run the client and server in development mode
2. **Testing**: Manual testing of features
3. **Building**: Create production builds of the client and server
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to a hosting environment

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development include:

- User authentication and authorization
- Enhanced visualization of agent performance
- More advanced tool configuration options
- Integration with additional AI models and services
- Collaborative features for team environments
