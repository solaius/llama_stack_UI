# Llama Stack UI - Current State Report

## Project Overview

Llama Stack UI is a comprehensive web application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with Llama Stack API endpoints. The application enables users to chat with Llama models, explore available tools, manage models, and configure various settings.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

- **Backend**: Express.js server (TypeScript) that proxies requests to the Llama Stack API
- **Frontend**: React application (TypeScript) with Material-UI components
- **API Integration**: Axios for API requests with proper error handling

## Conclusion

The Llama Stack UI project has made significant progress with most of the core functionality implemented. The main issue to resolve is the proxy connection between the client and server. Once this is fixed, the focus should be on testing, performance optimization, and preparing for production deployment.

The application provides a solid foundation for interacting with Llama Stack API endpoints, and with the planned enhancements, it will become a comprehensive tool for developers and end users working with generative AI applications.
