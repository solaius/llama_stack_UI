# Llama Stack UI - Current State Report

## Project Overview

Llama Stack UI is a comprehensive web application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with Llama Stack API endpoints. The application enables users to chat with Llama models, explore available tools, manage models, and configure various settings.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

- **Backend**: Express.js server (TypeScript) that proxies requests to the Llama Stack API
- **Frontend**: React application (TypeScript) with Material-UI components
- **API Integration**: Axios for API requests with proper error handling

## Current State

The application has been significantly enhanced with improved API integration, agent management features, and a dedicated chat interface. The proxy connection issues have been resolved, and the application now supports direct communication with the Llama Stack API.
